> The __E__xternal __A__sset and __R__esource __L__inker Plugin for Statamic

##Introduction
Howdy y'all. Muh name's Earl. I do one thang an' one thang only: I help yuh link to external whirlygigs and thingamabobs from yer Statamic site. Have files on a CDN or some such nonsense that you need to link to? That's why yuh got me. I'll help yuh drop in simple tags that point to where you need. Sounds downright handy don't it? Well, that's cause it is. 

But since I'm such a nice guy, I'll go the extra mile for yuh. I'll even let you define specific paths and file extensions you can use on demand. No more havin' to remember that really long URL some other knucklehead stores assets in everytime you want to link to a file. 

I know yer interested. Keep on readin' down to learn how to use it.
